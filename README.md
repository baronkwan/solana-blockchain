#solana-blockain

This is a set of tutorials for learning how to interact with the Solana blockchain with Javascript. Tutorials are from https://learn.figment.io/, which is a great place to learn more about the web3 technology as a developer.

### What is Solana?

Solana is an open-source project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain. From Messari's Solana profile, its goal is to provide a platform that enables developers to create DApps without needing to design around performance bottlenecks. Solana features a new timestamp system called Proof-of-History (PoH) that enables automatically ordered transactions. It also uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to help secure the network. Additional design goals include sub-second settlement times, low transaction costs, and support for all LLVM compatible smart contract languages.

## Summary

In this repo, I learnt
- How Solana works
- How to setup project to connect and interact with Solana blockchain
- How to create address with keypair on Solana blockchain
- How to retreive, send and receive address balance on Solana blockchain
- How to deplot a program (=smart contract in other protocols) to read state and modify state on the Solana blockcahin
